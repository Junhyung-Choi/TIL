- What I learned: 
  - Daily routine
    - It traded CPUs, mainboards, and RAM secondhand. I bought it cheaper than I thought.
    - The price of the card made by the corporation was 30,000 won. I returned it and received it in addition to my daily wage.
    - I booked a bus ticket from Ansan to Daejeon on the app, which was not a QR code method but a ticketing method.
    - There was a bus from Daejeon Complex Terminal to Yuseong Terminal.This bus doesn't run late at night, so I'll have to get down early.
- What was interesting: 
  - There was a name Dongmakgol in Ansan. I'll have to find out if it's the same place I know.
- What I regret: 
  - I got off the bus after passing two stations to see my cell phone. It was quite hard because the weather was very hot.
