- What I learned: 
  - Smart Sensor and Actuator
    - How to assemble a robot.
    - How to download the code to the robot.
- What was interesting: 
  - It was really fun to take a class where I put the code in the robot and replay it.
- What I regret: 
  - I woke up too late because the class was 2 o'clock.
  - I should have installed the program on my laptop in advance, but I was embarrassed to go and do it.
