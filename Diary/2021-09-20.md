- What I learned: 
  - Smart Sensor and Actuator
    - RobotC and C languages.
      - 32 keywords
      - structered language
         - flow of control (if , while, for)
         - function
         - pointer
      - ROOBOTC rules.
      - Time (delay) function.
      - Data storage and calculation.
      - Select/execute conditions.
      - Repeatedly.
      - Function.
      - Arrangement.
      - Motor and sensor settings.
        - After setting up a physical motor and sensor, the code can be written accordingly.
      - At least one main() function is required
        - Additional functions can be set.
      - The preprocessing phrase is declared outside of the function.
        - Using #. It's also called a macro.
      - Without sleep(), the time the code executes is too short than the time a person feels.
        - The motor of the physical world can be adjusted by putting the main task to sleep() and giving the remaining time slice to the motor.
- What was interesting: 
  - It was first time to learn about something in Smart Sensor and Actuator class
- What I regret: 
  - Watched it too late
