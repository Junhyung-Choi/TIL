- What I learned: 
  - Academic Writing
  - Computer Algorithm
    - Tree(R Tree, B Tree, KD Tree, KDB Tree)
  - AR/VR
    - How to connect and recognize devices and computers.
- What was interesting: 
  - There were few side effects even if they were vaccinated. Is it because it hurt a lot in the first round?
- What I regret: 
  - My throat hurts because I talked too much about the exam period for academy children.
