- What I learned:
  - Algorithm
    - Cycles must exist in the problem of single-drawing.
    - The problem of finding fake coins can be solved through a split-conquest algorithm.
- What was interesting:
  - After studying algorithms through books, it is good to learn them systematically.
- What I regret:
  - I overslept because the hackathon was over.
