- What I learned:
  - CPP
    - Can use class extends struct
      - cannot access to variable outside of class
      - ex) Car run99 = {"run9", 100, 0}; (x)
  - Unity
    - Canvas covers Camera
    - Canvas render objects in order to hierarchy
- What was interesting: 
  - Had a meeting with likelions friend
- What I regret: 
  - Use too many times on moving
