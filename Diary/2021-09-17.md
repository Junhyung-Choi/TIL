- What I learned: 
  - Daily routine
    - Express buses at the beginning of the Chuseok holiday are very congested.
- What was interesting: 
  - I didn't want to pee when I took the bus without eating anything.
- What I regret: 
  - I think I could have arrived home on time if I took a bus at a faster time in anticipation of the early completion of the practice.
