- What I learned:
  - Django
    - Models
      - Fields
        - AutoField
        - BigAutoField
        - BigIntegerField: 64bit signed integer field
        - BinaryField: strongly recommend not to use
        - BooleanField
        - CharField
        - DateField
        - DateTimeField
        - DecimalField/FloatField
        - DurationField
        - EmailField: based on CharField
        - FileField
        - IntegerField
        - GenericIpAddressField
- What was interesting: 
  - Django's field is not exactly same with SQL
- What I regret: 
  - My bike was stolen, didn't took a picture, didn't know bike's type
