- What I learned:
  - CPP
    - Can make struct without using typedef
      - ex) struct Car{...}; -> Car run99;
    - Can intialize struct by using {}
      - ex) struct Car {int a; float b; string c;}; -> Car run99 = {1,0.1,"abc"};
    - Can use :: to scope struct
      - ex) struct Car{void ShowCar();}; -> void Car::ShowCar(){...}
  - Unity
    - Deactivated Objects cannot use on Scripts
    - Controlling Alpha status will be better way to control UI 
- What was interesting: 
  - Having family talk
- What I regret: 
  - Took a nap
