- What I learned:
  - Algorithm
    - Advanced Sorting Algorithm
      - Merge Sort
        - use divide and conquer
      - Quick Sort
      - Heap Sort
      - Radix Sort
        - Stable sort
      - Counting Sort
    - Selection Algorithm
- What was interesting: 
  - The progress of the algorithm class has finally shifted from the alignment algorithm to the selection algorithm.
- What I regret: 
  - I think I have to take the class again because I can't concentrate on the class.
