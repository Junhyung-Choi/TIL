- What I learned:
  - Algorithm
    - 2096
      - Window Sliding Technique
        - how a nested for loop in some problems can be converted to a single for loop to reduce the time complexity.
        - Time complexity and space complexity can be reduced by applying only the newly increased or decreased part to the existing calculation result.
