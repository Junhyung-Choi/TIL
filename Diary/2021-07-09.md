- What I learned:
  - OS
    - Deadlocks
      - System Models
      - Deadlock Characterization
        - Deadlock can arise if four conditions hold simultaneously
          - **Mutual exclusion**
          - **Hold and wait**
          - **No preemption**
          - **Circular wait**
      - Method for Handling Deadlocks
        - Ensuring that the system will never enter a deadlock state
        - Allowing the system to enter a deadlock state and then recover
        - Ignore the proble, and pretend that deadlocks never ocur in the system; used by most opreating systems, including UNIX
      - Deadlock Prevention
      - Deadlock Avoidance
      - Deadlock Detection
      - Recovery from Deadlock
- What was interesting: 
  - First time to know about Deadlock
  - last class before test
- What I regret: 
  - Didn't pre-learned about this chapter
