- What I learned:
  - The commitment time between the git and the github is different.
- What was interesting:
  - I found a good sale at a good price.
  - It was my first time to get tested for covid. I think the inner part of the nose feels a little sore.
  - I went to an interview for a part-time job in production. I have to get up early tomorrow morning.
  - It rained. The weather seems to have cooled down a lot.
- What I regret:
  - From previous transactions, I lost money because I did used transactions without looking at the price properly.
