- What I learned: 
  - Daily routine
    - I found out during a conversation with my grandmother that there was one more uncle.

  - There is a problem with the monitor board used at home, so the signal is not working.
- What I regret: 
  - I should have turned on my laptop and did my assignment in advance.
