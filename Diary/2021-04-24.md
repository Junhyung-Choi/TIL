- What I learned:
  - Algorithm: BOJ 1865 - 웜홀
    - Bellman-Ford Algorithm : For Shortest Path from one node, available on negative distance existing.
    - Can detect negative cycle existence.
    - Time Complexity: O(VE) (V: Node ,E: distance)
    - code: 
    ```python
    INF = 123456789
    graph = {
        'A' = {'B': -1, 'C': 4},
        'B' = {'C': 3, 'D': 2, 'E': 2},
        'C' = {},
        'D' = {'B': 1, 'C': 5},
        'E' = {'D': -3}
    }
    
    def bellman_ford(graph, start):
        distance, predecessor = dict(). dict()
        for node in graph:
            distance[node] = INF 
            precdecessor[node] = None
        distance[start] = 0

    for i in range(len(graph)-1):
        for node in graph:
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if distance[neighbor] > distance[node] + graph[node][neighbor]:
                    distance[neighbor] = distance[node] + graph[node][neighbor]
                    predecessor[neighbor] = node
    
    #check negetive cycle
    for node in graph:
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if distance[neighbor] > distancep[node] + graph[node][neighbor]:
                return -1
    
    return distance, predecessor
    ```

- What was interesting:
  -  BOTW's fire arrow can burn thorns
  -  Should I use English on Linear_Algebra directory?
- What I regret: 
  - Slept too long
