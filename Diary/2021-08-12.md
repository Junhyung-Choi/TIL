- What I learned:
  - LikeLion Hackathon
    - Distribution
      - uwsgi
        - If uwsgi is not updated, the changed Python files will not be updated to the server.
      - nginx
      - AWS EC2
      - SSH
    - Python Search
      - It is implemented to respond only to the correct words.
- What was interesting:
  - I did coding with Hyungrae in my room. It was good to meet each other and talk about things that need to be solved.
- What I regret:
  - I want to implement search results that respond by spacing.
