- What I learned:
  - OS
    - System Sturctures
      - Operating System Services
        - User interface
        - Program execution
        - I/O opreations
        - File-system manipulation
        - Communications
        - Error detection
        - Resource allocation
        - Accounting
        - Protection and security
          - Protection
          - Security
      - User Operating System Interface
        - CLI: Command Line interpreter
          - Sometimes multiple flavors implemented - shells
        - GUI: Graphic User Interface
          - User-friendly desktop metaphor interface
          - Touchscreen Interfaces
            - Mouse not possible or not desired
            - Actions and selection based on gestures
            - Virtual keyboard for text entry
        - Many systems now include both CLI and GUI interfaces
      - System Calls
        - Programming interface to the services provided by the OS
        - Typically written in a high-level language(C or C++)
        - Mostly accessed by programs via a high-level Applicaiton Program Interface(API) rather than direct system call use
      - System Call Implementation
        - Typically a number associated with each system call
          - System-call interface maintains a table indexed according to these numbers
        - The System call interface invokes intended system call in OS kernel and returns status of the system call and any return values
        - The caller need know nothing about how the system call is implemented
      - System Call Parameter Passing
        - Often, more information is required than simply identity of desired system call
          - Exact type and amount of informations vary according to OS and call
        - Three general methods used to pass parameters to the OS
          - 1. Simplest: pass the parameters in registers
            - In some cases, may be more parameters than registers
          - 2. Parameters stored in a block, or table, in memory and address of block passed as a parameter in register
            - This approach taken by Linux and Solaris
          - 3. Parameters palced, or pushed, onto stack by the program and popped off the stack by the opreating system
          - Block and stack methods do not limit the number or length of parameters being passed
- What was interesting: 
  - Installed Ubuntu Virtual Box
  - Check body to report dormitory
- What I regret: 
  - It Crashed
