- What I learned: 
  - Daily routine
    - I went to a factory part-time job.
    - It was a task of aligning copper plates from machines.
    - I divided 240 plates into two and arranged them on a tray.
    - Katsu-dong for lunch and short rib patties for dinner.
    - The daily wage was 100,000 won, and the work was not as hard as I thought, but it was physically difficult.
- What was interesting: 
  - I made more money than I thought, so it helped me fit the computer.
- What I regret: 
  - I couldn't meet the transaction date because I suddenly worked overtime.
