- What I learned: 
  - Daily routine
    - Bean sprouts need to be blanched to reduce nutrient loss.
- What was interesting: 
  - For the first time, I made side dishes in my own room. It was a good quality.
- What I regret: 
  - I couldn't ventilate because of the bug. I think it would have been better to just hold it and open it.
