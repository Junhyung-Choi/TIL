- What I learned:
  - BOJ
    - 1021
      - I solved the problem which I solved with Python again with C.
      - I couldn't find the library that implements the queue.
      - So when we pulled out the numbers, we solved the problem by reducing the number one from the list of numbers to subtract.
- What was interesting:
  - It's motivating to do problem solving with Jihoon.
- What I regret:
  - I haven't solved the algorithm for too long, so my skills seem to have decreased.
