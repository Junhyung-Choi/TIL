- What I learned: 
  - SQL
    - Data Anomalies: Cases where inserts, updates, and deletions cannot be performed properly in the database
      - insertion anomaly: inability to add data to the database due to the absence of other data.
      - update anomaly: data inconsistency that result from data redundancy and a partial update.
      - deletion anomaly: the unintended loss of data due to deletion of other data.
      - It is caused by poor data modeling
    - Normalization: Process of splitting relations into well-structured relations that allow users to insert, delete, and update tuples without introducing database inconsistencies.
      - Make the table to a normal form
      - 1NF, 2NF, 3NF...
      - Rules are accumulated in order.
      - It is good to create a data model and apply it before implementing it into the database.
    - 1NF: The column values of all rows in table must be a single, indivisible value.
      - Structure that is prone to NULL
      - The number of columns to be added is unclear
      - When you store multiple values of the same kind in a column.
        - Model the corresponding columns separately into one table.
      - When you store multiple values of the diffrent kind in a column.
        - Model the coreesponding columns separately into several columns.
