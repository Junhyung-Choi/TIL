- What I learned:
  - BOJ
    - 17103 / Goldbach Partition 
      - Eratosthenes' sieve.
      - ```c++
        bool isPrime[MAX+1] = {0,};
        isPrime[0] = true;
        isPrime[1] = true;
        for(int i=2; i<MAX+1; i++)
        {
            if(isPrime[i] == false)
            {
                for(int j=i*2; j<MAX+1; j+=i)
                {
                    isPrime[j] = true;
                }
            }
        }

        for(int i=1; i<MAX+1; i++)
        {
            isPrime[i] = !isPrime[i];
        }
        ```

- What was interesting:
  - I finished organizing my clothes. It was a rewarding day.
- What I regret:
  - I had to do some outside activities, but I couldn't. I should get up early tomorrow, take classes, and organize what to do in the afternoon.
