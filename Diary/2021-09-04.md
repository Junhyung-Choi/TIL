- What I learned:
  - C#
    - In statics functions, only statics variables can be called.
    - Within the static function, the Find method is not available.
    - Application.Quit() method allows you to terminate a program.
    - generic
      - Generics introduces the concept of type parameters to .NET, which make it possible to design classes and methods that defer the specification of one or more types until the class or method is declared and instantiated by client code.
- What was interesting: 
  - Learned about generic, static ...etc
- What I regret: 
  - Didn't prepare session on LikeLion Meeting enough.
