- What I learned:
  - OS
    - System Programs
      - System programs provide a convenient envrionment for program development and execution. They can be deivided into
        - File mainpulation
          - File management - Create, delete, copy, rename, print, dump, list, and generally manipulate files and directories
          - File modification - Text editors to create and modify files
        - Status information sometimes stored in a File modification
          - Some ask the system for info - date, time, amount of available memory, disk space, number of users
        - Programming langauge support
          - Comilers, assemblers, debuggers and interpreters sometimes provided
        - Program loading and execution
          - Absolute loaders, relocatabale loaders, linkage editors, and overlay-loaders, debugging systems for higher-level and machine lanaguage
        - Communications
          - Provide the mechanism for creating virtual connections among processes, users, and computer systems
            - Allow users to send messages to one another's screens, browse web pages, send electronic-mail messages, log in remotely, transfer files from one machine to another
        - Background services
          - Launch at boot time
            - Some for system startup, then terminate
            - Some from system boot to shutdown
          - Known as services, subsystems, daemons
        - Application programs
          - Don't pertain to system
          - Run by users
    - Opreating System Design and Implementation
      - Internal sturcture of different Operating Systems can vary widely
      - Start by defining goals and specifications
      - Affected by choice of hardware, type of system
      - User goal and System goals
        - User: should be convenient to use, easy to learn, reliable, safe, and fast
        - System: should be easy to design, implement, and maintain, as well as flexible, reliable, error-free and efficient
      - Important principle to separate policy and mechanism
      - Specifying and designing OS is highly creative task of software engineering
    - Operating System Structure
      - MS-DOS: application program, resident system program, MS-DOS device drivers, ROM BIOS device drivers
      - UNIX - limited by hardware functionality. consists of two separable parts [System Programs / The kernel]
    - Layered Approach
      - The opreating system is divided into a nubmer of layres, each built on top of lower layers.
      - With modularity, layers are selected such that each user functions and services of only lower-level layers
    - Microkernel System Structure
      - Moves as much from the kernel into user space
      - Communication takes place between user modules using message passing
    - Modules
      - Most mdern opreating system implement loadable kerenl modules
        - Ex) Solaris
    - Hybrid Systems
      - Most modern operating systems actually not one pure model.
      - MAC OS X
      - IOS
      - Android
    - Operating-System Debugging
      - Debugging is finding and fixing errors, or bugs
      - OS generate log files containing error information
      - Failure of an application can generate core dump file memeory of the process
      - Operating System failure can generate crash dump file containing kerenl memory
    - Oprerating System Generation
      - Opreating Systems are designed to run on any of a class of machines
      - SYSGEN program obtains information concerning the specific configuration of the hardware system
        - Used to build system-specific compiled kernel or system-tuned
        - Can general more efficient code than one general kernel
    - System Boot
      - When power initialized on system, execution starts at a fixed memory location
        - Firmware ROM used to hold inital boot code
        - Small piece of code - bootstrap loader, stored in ROM or EEPROM locates the kernel, loads it into memory, and starts it
        - Sometimes two-step process where boot block at fixed location loaded by ROM code, which loads bootstrap loader from disk
      - Common bootstrap loader GRUB allows selection of kernel from multiple disks, versions, kernel options
      - Kernel loads and system is then running
- What was interesting: 
  - Finished OS Chapter 2
- What I regret:
  - None
