- What I learned: 
  - C, Linux
    - printf("\e[35mhi\n");
    - Using the above code, it is possible to adjust the font color of the terminal in C language in a Linux environment.
- What was interesting: 
  - When I started studying algorithms again from the perspective of equations, I think I had a different field of view.
- What I regret:
  -  I submitted my algorithm assignment a little late, but I'm worried.
