- What I learned: 
  - Daily routine
    - When using a vesa hole for a curved monitor, a dedicated vesa hole extension screw shall be purchased.
    - There is a detachable latch at the end of the terminal of the dp line.
- What was interesting: 
  - It is embarrassing to use a 27-inch dual monitor because it is too wide horizontally.
- What I regret: 
  - If you bought a longer DP line, the selection process will be cleaner.
