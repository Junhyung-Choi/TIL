- What I learned:
  - SQL
    - Functional Dependency ex) product -> brand -> brand_country
      - brand_country has transitive functional dependency to product
    - Candidate Key
      - a set of attributes that uniquely identify tuples in a table.
    - Prime attributes: the attributes of the candidate key which defines the uniqueness.
      - non-prime attributes: the attributes which aren't prime attributes.
    - 2NF
      - Must match 1NF
      - There should be no non-prime attribute that has functional dependency for only a part of candidate key in the table
    - 3NF
      - Must match 3NF
      - All attributes in the table must have a functional dependency only on the primary key
      -  (paraphrase) All attributes in the table must be directly the contents of the table Entity
    - Physical Modeling
      - The process of creating a data model as close as possible to waht you actually store in the database.
      - Naming
        - Singular/plural
          - Normally, column use singular name
          - Should decide whether to give the table singular/plural names.
        - Determining capital letters/spaces
          - underbar: user_id
          - Camel: UserId
          - Camel_1: userId
        - abbrevitation:
          - social_security_number vs ssn
        - It is more important to follow the rules than to set the rules
      - Data Type
        - Numeric types
          - Integer types
            - TINYINT: 1byte
            - SMALLINT: 2byte
            - MEDIUMINT: 3byte
            - INT: 4byte
            - BIGINT: 8byte
          - Real types
            - DECIMAL: (65,30)
              - Same: DEC,NUMERIC,FIXED
            - FlOAT: -3.402823466E+38 ~ -1.175494351E-38, 0, 1.175494351E-38 ~ 3.402823466E+38
            - DOUBLE: -1.7976931348623157E+308 ~ -2.2250738585072014E-308, 0, 2.2250738585072014E-308 ~ 1.7976931348623157E+308
        - Date and Time types
          - DATE: `2020-03-26`
          - DATETIME: `2020-03-26 09L30:27`
          - TIMESTAMP: `2020-0-26 09:30:27` + time_zone
          - TIME: `09:27:31`
        - String types
          - CHAR(`n`): Strings can be stored as many as n(0~255)
          - VARCHAR(`n`): Variable length type
          - TEXT(~65535),MEDIUMTEXT(3byte),LONGTEXT(4byte)
      - Index
        - Clustered Index: Index that stores the table itself in a specific order
          - The nquiry speed is very fast
          - Index can be created only one
          - A concept similar to a language dictionary
        - Non-Clustered Index: 
          - Leave the table itself and store the order elsewhere
          - Index can be created on all columns
          - A bit slower than Clustered Index
          - A concept similar to the index of a regular book
        - Index Update Problem
          - Indexs can make lookups faster, but inserts, updates, and deletes are slower.
        - Basic principles of index addition
          - Make indexs for every primary key
          - Make indexs for every foreing key
          - When it is certain that a specific search query is or gonna be too slow  ,create indexes for the columns used for the search.
  - Linera Algebra
    - Diagonalize
      - Diagonalizable matrix : Square matrix A if there exists an invertible matrix P and a diagonal matrix D such that $P^{-1} AP = D$ or equivalently $A = PDP^{-1}$
        - P : Diagonalizing Matrix
      - Useful on dynamical system
      - Similarity Matrix: two n-by-n matrices A and B are called similar if there exists an invertible n-by-n matrix P such that $B=P^{-1}AP.$
        - Similarity Transformation : matrix transformations of the form $A → P^{−1}AP$
        - If A similar to B, A and B has same determinant,eigenvalue,multiplicity
      - If $A = PDP^{-1}$ is expressible,for necessary and sufficient condition, P's column is A's linear depedent eigenvector(n E/A) and D's main diagonal is A's eigenvalues.
      - Checking Diagonalizable:
        - When n by n matrix has n E/A linear dependent eigenvectors
        - When n by n matrix has n E/A unique

- What I regret: 
  - Ate too much
