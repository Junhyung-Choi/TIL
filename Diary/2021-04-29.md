- What I learned:
  - Linear Algebra:
    - To find Dominant Eigenvalue and Eigenvector, We can use Power method.
    - $x_k+1 ={1 \over u_k}Ax_k$ 
    - $u_k$ is dominant eigenvalue of A, Coverging vector $x_k+1$ is eigenvector.
    - It can be used for analyzing long term behavior of Dynamical System.
  - Unity:
    - To use korean font on Unity, I need to import korean font on TextMesh Pro Panel, and save as assets.
- What was interesting:
  - Refactored Choicement code on Unity project. Gonna find way to manage it clearly. 
- What I regret: 
  - Should attend STUDYWITHME yesterday. Didn't predict that I will go trip tomorrow.
