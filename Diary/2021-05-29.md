- What I learned: 
  - Django auth
    - authenticate
      - server to db, db to server
    - login,logout
      - client to server, server to client
    - from django.contrib.auth.forms import AuthenticationForm, UserCreationForm
    - from django.contrib.auth import login,logout,authenticate
    - request: has `method,POST` property
    - form = AuthenticationForm(request = request, data = request.POST)
    - form: has `is_valid(),cleaned_data.get("username"),cleaned_data.get("password")` method
    - can authenticate by using `authenticate(request = request, username = username, password = password)`
      - which returns user object
    - can login by login(request, user)
  - CSRF
    - CSRF attack
    - CSRF token
  - POST/GET
- What was interesting: 
  - CSRF meaning
