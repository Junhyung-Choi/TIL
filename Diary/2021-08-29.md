- What I learned: 
  - C++
    - static (global variable / member variable)
    - As member variable
      - A variable is assigned to the class area, not to an object.
      - Therefore, initialization should not be carried out in the generator function.
- What was interesting: 
  - Through the compilation process, I was able to understand the reason for the code logically.
- What I regret: 
  - I slept too late to watch the drama.
