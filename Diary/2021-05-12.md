- What I learned:
    - Linear Algebra
        -  if A is a m x n matrix, u and v are vectors in $R^n$, and c is a sclalr, then
            - A(u+v) = Au + Av
            - A(cu) = c(Au)
        - Homogeneous Linear Systems
            - Ax = 0 always has at least one solution x = 0(trivial solution)
                - nontrivial solution: if and only if the equatio has at least one free variable
                - `Theorem`
                    - If a linear system is consistent, then the solution set constains either a unique solution, when threr are no free variables, or infinitely many solutions, when there is at least one free variables.
                - The solution set of Ax = 0 can always be expressed as Span{v1,...,vp}
                    - Trivial Solution: Span{0}
- What was interesting:
    - Job interview(Part Time)
        - TinTin Math&Coding Academy
    - Customizing My Window Theme & Skin
        - It's more regrettable than expected, but I'm satisfied
- What I regret:
