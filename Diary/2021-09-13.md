- What I learned: 
  - Smart Sensor and Actuator
    - I think I learned simply what EV3 is to be used in the practice class, the types and ways of operating sensors and actuators.
- What was interesting: 
  - I'm looking forward to using Lego in class.
- What I regret:
  - I woke up too late because the class started late.
