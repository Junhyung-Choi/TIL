- What I learned: 
  - OS(Windows)
    - To make a new hard disk recognized in Windows, enter the Manage tab on my PC, register the hard disk, and proceed with the formatting and volume setup process.
- What was interesting: 
  - I installed 500GB of SSD for program installation, but I like it because it's more spacious than I thought.
  - I took away all the garbage that I was recycling, and there was more room in my house.
- What I regret: 
  - I took a long nap and the day feels shorter.
