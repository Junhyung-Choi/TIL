- What I learned:
  - Python COS 1st grade
    -  Flower
       -  ```python
            def solution(garden):
                queue = deque()
                gardensize = len(garden)
                timemat = [[0] * gardensize for _ in range(gardensize)]
                for i in range(gardensize):
                    for j in range(gardensize):
                        if garden[i][j] == 1:
                            queue.append((i,j))
                while queue:
                    blmx,blmy = queue.popleft()
                    for dx,dy in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]:
                        nx = blmx + dx
                        ny = blmy + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < gardensize and 0 <= ny < gardensize and garden[nx][ny] == 0:
                            garden[nx][ny] = 1
                            timemat[nx][ny] = timemat[blmx][blmy] + 1
                            queue.append((nx,ny))
                answer = -1
                for i in range(gardensize):
                    for j in range(gardensize):
                        if timemat[i][j] > answer:
                            answer = timemat[i][j]
                return answer
          ```
    -  Getnumber
       -  ```python
            def solution(arr, K):
                arr.sort()
                answer = 123456789
                for i in range(len(arr)-K+1):
                    print(i)
                    answer = min(answer,arr[i+K-1] - arr[i])
                return answer
          ```
    -  Notepad
       -  ```python
            def solution(K, words):
                line = len(words[0])
                answer = 1
                for word in range(1,len(words)): 
                    if line + len(words[word]) + 1 > K:
                        line = len(words[word])
                        answer += 1
                    else:
                        line += len(words[word]) + 1
                return answer
          ```
- What was interesting: 
  - Solve All COS Pro
- What I regret: 
  - Gotta make PPT
