- What I learned: 
  - C++
    - const static
      - Static member variables can only be initialized by an external initializer. 
      - However, the const static member variable can be initialized simultaneously with the declaration.
- What was interesting: 
  - I tried to initialize the static member variable simultaneously with the declaration, but there is an error. I don't think it's correct grammar.
- What I regret: 
  - I couldn't correct my life pattern.
