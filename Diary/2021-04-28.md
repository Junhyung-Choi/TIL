- What I learned:
  - Unity: To use JSON on Unity, Need `[System.Serializable]` over class.
    - JsonUtility.ToJson(variable): make variable to JSON format
    - JsonUtility.FromJson<classname>(string): string must be JSON format. Make string to classname format
    - `[System.Serializable]`: Some indicator that under class changable to JSON format.
  - Linear Algebra:
    - Characteristic polunomial
      - Given a square matrix $A$, if we expand the determinant $det(A- \lambda I)$ the result is a polynmial in variable $\lambda$, and is called characteristic polynomial of $A$
      - The roots of the characteristic polynomial are precisely the eigenvalues of $A$.
