- What I learned:
    - QR Factorization
        - Q: m x n matrix, columns are orthonormal basis
        - R: n x n upper triangluar matrix
            - A = QR
            - Q^{T}A = Q^{T}QR -> Q^{T}A = R
    - Python
        - for, while animation
- What was interesting:
    - None
- What I regret: 
    - None
