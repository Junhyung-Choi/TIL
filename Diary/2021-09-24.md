- What I learned: 
  - Smart Sensor and Actuator
    - `#pragma` : one of a kind of macro which is processed by preprocessor
    - sleep() : Delayed the task and handed over the time slice to the next task.
- What was interesting: 
  - The purpose was to just put the robot arm down and lock it in the grid, which I thought would pick something up.
- What I regret: 
  - I didn't think the direction of lowering the robot's arm would be negative.
