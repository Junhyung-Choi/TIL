        - Economy, Employment, Real Estate
        - Research, Law, Statistics...etc
      - Characteristic
        - Integrated data
        - Stored data
        - Opreational data
        - Shared data
        - Real time accessibility
        - Continuous change
        - Concurrent sharing
        - Reference by content
    - Why Database?
      - Information System
      - Advance of Information System
        - File System -> Database System -> Web Database System(Distributed Database System)
    - Database System
      - Architectures of Database
        - Internal Level
          - Physical POV
          - Unique Internal Schema
        - Conceptual Level
          - Organizational POV
          - Unique Conceptual Schema
        - External Level
          - Individual Users POV
          - Several External Schema
        - Each levels provide unique abstractions
        - Schema : The data structure and constraints stored in the database are defined.

      - Data Language
        - SQL
  - AI + X : Deep Learning
- What was interesting: 
  - It was good chance to review database
- What I regret: 
  - AI + X class was little bit bored.
