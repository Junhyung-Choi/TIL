- What I learned:
  - Linear_Algebra : Invert A = (1/detA)*(adjA)
  - Absolute Determinant A means A's area & volume
  - Dynamical System : $x_{k+1} = Ax_{k} (k=0,1,2....)$
  - Eigenvector: If $T$ is a linear transformation from a vector space $V$ over a field $F$ into itself and $v$ is a nonzero vector in $V$, then $v$ is an eigenvector of $T$ if $T(v)$ is a scalar multiple of $v$. This can be written as $T(v) = \lambda v$
  - Eigenvalue : &lambda;
  - Eigenspace : Spanning set of Eigenvector, because of definition of space, Eigenspace contain zerovector.
- What was interesting: Did OPIC Test, not good at speaking. Need to practice
- What I regret: Took a nap too much, Fought with mom, gotta apologize
