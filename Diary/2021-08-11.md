- What I learned:
  - LikeLion Hackathon
    - With only one button to control each row, JavaScript syntax was created on whether the button created by each card should click the row control button or change the contents of the accordion.
- What was interesting:
  - It's worthwhile that I think I've done a great job of implementing the difference between card and row buttons.
- What I regret:
  - I think it took too much time to implement one of the above movements.
