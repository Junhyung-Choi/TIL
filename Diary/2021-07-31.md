- What I learned:
  - Algorithm
    - BFS
      - returning list, tuple can be a good way to find longest, shortest node and distance
  - Reductio ad absurdum; RAA
    - the form of arguemnt that attempts to establish a claim by showing that the opposite secnario would lead to absurdity or contradiction
- What was interesting: 
  - There is so many things that I should learn
- What I regret: 
  - I was so lazy that the season semester ended
