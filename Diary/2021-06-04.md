- What I learned:
  - Operating System Opreations
    - Interrupt driven by hardware
    - Software error or request creates exception or trap
      - Division by zero, request for operating system service
    - Ohter process problems include infinite loop, processes modifying each other or the operating system
      - Dual-mode operation allows OS to protect itself and other system components
        - User mode and kernel mode
        - Mode bit provided by hardware
          - Provides ability to distinguish when system is runing user code or kernel code
          - Some instructions designated as privileged, only excutable in kernel mode
          - System call changes mode to kernel, return from call resets it to user
  - Increasingly CPUs support multi-mode operations
    - Transition from User to Kernel Mode
      - Timer to prevent infinite loop / process hogging resources
        - Set interrupt after specific period
        - Operating system decrements counter
        - When counter zero generate an interrupt
        - Set up before scheduling process to regain control or terminate program that exceeds allotted time
    - Process Management
      - A process is a program in execution. It is a unit of work within the system. Program is a pssive entity, process is an active entity
      - Process needs resources to accomplish its task
        - CPU, memeory, I/O, files
        - Initialization data
      - Process termination requires reclaim of any reusable resources
      - Single-threaded process has one program counter specifying location of next instruction to execute
        - Process executes instructions sequentially, one at a time, untill completion
      - Multi-threaded process has one program counter per thread
      - Typically system has many processes, some user, some opreating system running concourrently on one or more CPUs
        - Concurrency by multiplexing the CPUs among the processes / threads
    - Process Management Activites
      - The opreating system is responsible for the following activites in connection with process management.
        - Creating and deleting both user and system processes
        - Suspending and resuming processes
        - Providing mechanisms for process synchronization
        - Providing mechanisms for process coummication
        - Providing mecahnisms for deadlock handling 
- What was interesting: 
  - Class Success
- What I regret: 
  - None
