- What I learned: 
  - CPP
    - Keyword `new`, `delete`
      - `new`: returning pointer
        - int* ptr = new int;
        - Point* p1 = new Point 
      - `delete`: free variable
        - delete ptr;
  - Django
    - static files
      - Sandwich Sturcture: `AppDirectory`/static/`AppDirectory`
        - Same as Templates
      - CSS,JavaScript,Fonts,Images...etc
    - `ProjectDirectory/settings.py`
      - `TEMPLATES[..., APP_DIRS : True, ...]`: 
        - Checking files connected with urls on `INSTALLED_APPS` from first to end
        - When there are files which have same name but on other apps and are not sandwich structure, problem happens.
        - That's why we use Sandwich Structure 
    - Template Extending
      - `{% block name %}`
      - `{% endblock name %}`
      - `{% extends 'directory }`
- What was interesting:
  - Getting New Class
- What I regret: 
  - Didn't Exercise
