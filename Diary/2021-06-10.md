- What I learned:
  - Java
    - Interface
      - use `implements` keyword
      - need to change class method towards public
  - CPP
    - delete
      - to delete referenced objects, type `delete & ref`
      - without using [], compilers delete arrays automatically in my environments.
      - But, always using [] is good habit
    - Can make destructor with using `~ClassName()`
    - Can use Initializer by using `:`
      - ex) class A {int num; A():num(0){}};
- What was interesting: 
  - Helped My sister
- What I regret: 
  - Didn't workout
