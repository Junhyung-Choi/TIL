- What I learned: 
  - BOJ
    - Diameter of Tree
      - Set a random node
      - Find a farthest node
      - Find a farthest node from previous node
      - distance between two previous nodes is a diameter of tree.
- What was interesting: 
  - Start to study algorithm again
- What I regret: 
  - I think I bought a wrong bike. It's too small for me.
