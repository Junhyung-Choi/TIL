- What I learned: 
  - Adobe XD
    - App for prototyping such as PC, mobile Internet page, and mobile app.
    - It is possible to intuitively and conveniently implement the operation of an Internet page or app operating in the corresponding environment. 
    - At the time of the beta version, it was an Experience design, but was changed to XD when it was officially released. 
    - The Windows platform version is dedicated to 64-bit Windows 10.
- What was interesting: 
  - Learning about prototyping
- What I regret: 
  - Didn't install xd
