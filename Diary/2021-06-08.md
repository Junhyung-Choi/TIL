- What I learned: 
  - OS
    - Memory Management
      - Memory management determines what is in memory when optimizing cpu utilization and computer response to users
      - Memory management activites
        - Keeping track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom
        - Deciding which processes(or parts thereof) and data to move into and out of memory
        - Allocating and deallocating memory space as needed
    - Storage Management
      - Os provides uniform, logical view of information storage
      - File-System management
        - Files usually organized into directories
        - Access control on most systems to determine who can access what
        - OS activities include
          - Creating and deleting files and directories
          - Primitives to amnipulate files and dirs
          - Mapping files onto secondary storage
          - Backup files onto stable (non-volatile) storage media
    - Mass Storage Management
      - Usually disks used to stroe data that does not fit in main memory or data that must be kept for a "long" period of time
      - Proper management is of central importance
      - Entire speed of computer operation hinges on disk subsystem and its algorithms
      - OS activities
        - Free-space management
        - Storage allocation
        - Disk scheduling
      - Some storage need not be fast
    - Migration of Integer A from Disk to Register
      - Multitasking environments must be careful to use most recent value, no matter where it is stored in the storage hierarchy
      - Multiporcessor environment must provide cache coherency in hardware such that all CPUs have the most recent value in their cache
      - Distributed environment situation even more complex
        - Several copies of a datum can exist
        - Various solutions covered in Chapter 17
    - I/O subsystem
      - One purpose of OS is to hide peculiarities of hardware devices from the user
      - I/O subsystem responsible for
        - Memeory management of I.O including
          - buffering(storing data temporarily while it is being transferred)
          - caching (storing parts of data in faster storage for performance)
          - spooling(the overlapping of output of one job with input of other jobs)
        - General device-driver interface
        - Drivers for specific hardware devices
    - Protection and Security
    - Kernel Data Structures
- What was interesting: 
  - Got wage
- What I regret:
  - Waste time
