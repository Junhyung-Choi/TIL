- What I learned:
  - SQL: Data Modeling
    - Logical Modeling: Establishing a conceptual structure
    - Pysical Modeling: Determining what you need to build a database
    - Data Model: A model arranged and organized for the purpose of using the data
    - Entity: A data which you want to store
      - Entity: Each and every real object(row)
      - Entity Type: normalized entity type(table)
    - Attribute: What you want to store about the entity(column)
    - Relationship: connection between entitys
    - Contraint: rule
    - Purpose of Data Modeling: 
      - To Identify Entity, Attribute, Relationship, Constraint in data you want to store
      - Making a model that will be the basis for building a database.
    - Relational Model
      - A model representing data in rows and columns.
      - **Warning** Relation is mathmatical expression representing a table.
      - Disadvantage
        - Rows are not needed when defining the structure
        - It is difficult to understand relationship between tables at once.
    - Entity Relationship Model(ERM): A model representing data in Entitys and Relationships.
    - Data Model is divided into three stages according to the scope of expression.
      - Conceptual Model: Big Entity and simple relationship
      - Logical Model: Conceptual Model + Attributes + Primary Key & Foreing Key
      - Pysical Model: Logical Model + Attribute's data type + Index(which will learn next course)
  - Clean code philosophy
    - YAGNI : You aren't gonna need it
    - KISS : Keep it simple, stupid
    - DRY: Don't repeat yourself
      - WET: Write Every Time, Write Everything Twice, Waste Everyone's Time ...etc
  - Linear Algebra
    - LU Decomposition
      - L : Lower trianguler matrix
      - U : Upper trianguler matrix
- What was interesting: 
  - Cut my hair
  - Refit glasses
- What I regret:
