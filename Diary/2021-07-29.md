- What I learned:
  - C++
    - vector container
      - array that allocated memeory automatically
      - need `<vector>` header file
      - can create vector by `vector<[data type]>`
      - `vector <int> v`
      - `vector <int> v(5)` : intialize 0, length : 5
      - `vector <int> v(5,2)`: intialize 2, length : 5
      - `vector <int> v2(v1)`: copy v1 as v2
- What was interesting: 
  - Start to learn about C++
- What I regret: 
  - Couldn't clear SC2
