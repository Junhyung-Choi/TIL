- What I learned:
  - Unix:
    - ps -ef : get process
    - \> or \< : can redirect input or output
    - |(pipe) : use to pass output
    - Pipe vs Redirect :
      - Pipe is used to pass output to another program or utility
      - Redirect is used to pass output to either a file or stream
    - Algorithm : BOJ 1504 - 특정한 최단 경로
      - Dijkstra algorithm
      - ```python
            def dijkstra(start):
                dp = [123456789 for i in range(node+1)]
                dp[start] = 0
                heap = []
                heapq.heappush(heap,[0,start])
                while heap:
                    current_distance,current_node = heapq.heappop(heap)
                    for next_node,next_distance in matrix[current_node]:
                        total_distance = next_distance + current_distance
                        if dp[next_node] > total_distance:
                            dp[next_node] = total_distance
                            heapq.heappush(heap,[total_distance,next_node])
                return dp

            result = min(origin[must_first]
                         + must_first_dp[must_second] 
                         + must_second_dp[node],
                        origin[must_second] 
                        + must_second_dp[must_first]
                        + must_first_dp[node])

            if result >= 123456789:
                print(-1)
            else:
                print(result)
        ```
- What was interesting: 
  - Watched video about [Map of computer science](https://youtu.be/SzJ46YA_RaA)
  - Start to study about Unix system & network programming
  - Get interested in NLP  
- What I regret: 
  - Woke up at 12PM, Didn't do anything before 3PM.
