- What I learned:
  - OS
    - Base and Limit Registers
      - A pair of base and limit registers define the logical address space
      - CPU must check every memory access generated in user mode to be sure it is between base and limit for that user
    - Address Binding
      - Programs on disk, ready to be brought into memory to execute form an input queue.
      - Inconveninet to have first user process physical address always at 0000
      - Further address represented in different ways at different stages of a program's life
    - Binding of Instructions and Data to Memory
      - Address binding of instructions and data to memory addresses can happen at three different stages
        - Compile time, Load time, Execution time
    - Logical vs Physical Address Space
      - The computer of a logical address space that is bound to a separate physical address space is central to proper memory management
        - Logical addresss - generated by the CPU, also referred as to virtual adress
        - Physical address - address seen bu the memory unit
    - Memory Management Unit
      - Hardware device that at run time maps virtual to physical address
    - Dynamic Linking
      - Static Linking - system libraries and program code combined by the loader into the binary program image
      - Dynamic linking - linking postponed untill execution time
    - Swapping
      - A process can be swapped temporarily out of memory to a backing store, and then brought back into memory for continued execution
        - Total physical memory space of processes can exceed physical memory
    - Contiguous Memory Allocation
      - Relocation registers used to protect user processes from each other, and from changing operation-system code and data
    - Segmentation
      - Memory-management scheme that supports user view of memory
    - Paging
      - Physical address space of a process can be noncontiguousl process is allocated physical memory whenever the latter is available
      - Divide logical memory into blocks of same sized called pages
      - Set up a page table to translate logical to physical addresses
    - Structure of the Page Table 
      - Memory structres for paging can get huge using straight-forward mehtods
      - Consider a 32-bit logical address space as on modern computers
      - Hierarchical Paging
      - Hashed Page Tables
      - Inverted Page Tables
