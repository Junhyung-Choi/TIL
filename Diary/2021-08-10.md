- What I learned:
  - LikeLion Hackathon
    - UPDATE Practice.html
      - JavaScript syntax, which is scheduled to work on the recommendation page, is being implemented. Looking for a way to solve the interworking part of accordion behavior for each row.
- What was interesting:
  - After a long time, I learned JavaScript again and remembered my military memories.
- What I regret:
  - I should have brought the bootstrap book which I had in the army.
