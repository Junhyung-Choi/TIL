    - Copy Constructor
    - keyword `explicit`
    - Shallow Copy / Deep Copy
    - When the copy constructor calls in
      - Initializing a new object using an existing created object.
      - When you pass an object to a factor during Call-by-value method of function invocation.
      - Returns the object, but does not return it as a reference.
