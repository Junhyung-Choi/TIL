- What I learned:
  - Linear Algebra
    - $A$ is $m \times n$ matirx, with columns $a_1,...,a_n$
    - The followings are all true or all false;
      - a. For each $b$ in $R^m$, $Ax = b$ has a solution
      - b. Each $b$ in $R^m$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$.
      - c. The columns of $A$ span $R^m$
      - d. $A$ has a pivot position in every row.
- What was interesting: 
  - Made up with my mom. My feelings get better. 
- What I regret: 
  - Because of Allergy, slept too much
  - Didn't play Ring Fit. Feel like stomach getting fat.
