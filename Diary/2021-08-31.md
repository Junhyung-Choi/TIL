- What I learned: 
  - C++
    - mutable
      - permits modification of the class member declared mutable even if the containing object is declared const.
      - May appear in the declaration of a non-static class members of non-reference non-const type
      - Mutable is used to specify that the member does not affect the externally visible state of the class (as often used for mutexes, memo caches, lazy evaluation, and access instrumentation).
- What was interesting: 
  - I'm looking forward to the start of school tomorrow.
- What I regret: 
  - I still haven't changed my lifestyle.
