- What I learned:
  - OS
    - Definition
      - widly
        - Everything a vendor ships when you order an operating system
      - narrowly
        - "The one program running at all times on the computer": Kernel
    - Compuer Startup
      - Bootstrap program is loaded at power-up or reboot
        - Typicaly stored in ROM or EPROM, generally known as firmware
        - Initialize all aspects of system
        - Loads opreating system kernel and starts execution
    - Computer System Organization
      - One or more CPUs, device controlllers connect through common bus providing access to shared memory
      - Concurrent execution of CPUs and devices competing for memory cycles
    - Computer System Operation
      - I/O Devices and the CPU can execute concurrently
      - Each device controller is in chare of a particular device type
      - Each device controller has a local buffer
      - CPU moves data from/to main memory to/from local buffers
      - I/O is from the device to local buffer of controller
      - Device controller imforms CPU that it has finished its operation by causing an interrupt
    - Common Functions of Interrupts
      - Interruipt transfers control to the interrupt service routine generally, through the interrupt vector, which contains the addresses of all the service routines
      - Interrupt architectrue must asve the address of the tinerrupted instruction
      - A trap or exception is a software-generated interrupt caused either by an error or a user request
      - An operating system is interrupt driven
    - Interrupt Handling
      - The operating system preserves the state of the CPU by storing registers and the program counter
      - Determines which type of tinerrupt has occurred
        - Polling(refers to actively sampling the status of an external device by a client program as a synchoronous activity.)
        - Vectored intrrupt system
      - Seperate segments of code determine what actions hould be taken for each type of interrupt
    - I/O Structure
      - Synchoronous System
        - After I/O starts, control returns to user program only upon I/O completion
          - Wait instruction idles the CPU until the next interrupt
          - Wait loop(contention for memory access)
          - At most one I/O request is outsatnding at a time, no simultaneous I/O processing
      - Asynchoronous System
        - After I/O starts, control returns to user program without waiting for I/O completion
          - System call - request to the OS to allow user to wait for I/O completion
          - Device status table contains entry for each I/O device status and to modify table entry to include interrupt
    - Storage Definitons and Notation Review
      - bit, byte, word, K,M,G,T,P
      - Networking measurements are an exception to this general rule
    - Direct Memory Access Structure
      - Used or high-speed I/O devices able to transmit information at close to memory speeds
      - Device controller transfers blocks of data from buffer storage directly to main memory without CPU intervention
      - Only one interrupt is generated per block, rather than the one interrupt per byte
    - Storage Structure
      - Main memory - only large storage media that the CPU can access directly
        - Random access
        - Typically volatile
      - Secondary Storage - extension of main memory that provides large nonvolatile storage capacity
        - Magnetic disks
        - Solid-State disks
    - Storage Hierarchy
      - Speed,Cost,Volatility
      - Caching - copying information into faster storage system; main memory can be viewed as a cache for secondary storage
      - Device Driver for each device controller to mange I/O
      - Provides uniform interface between controller and kernel
    - Caching
      - Important principle, perfomed at many levels in a computer (in hardware, operating system, software)
      - Informatiuon in use copied from solwer to faster storage temporarily
      - Faster storage(cache) checked first to determine if information is there
        - If it is, information used directly from the cache(fast)
        - If not, data copied to cache and used there
      - Cache smaller than storage being cached
        - Cache management important design problem
        - Cache size and replacement policy
    - Computer System Architecture
      - Most systems use a single general-purpose processor(PDAs through mainframes)
        - Most systems have special-purpose processors as well
      - Multiprocessors systems growing in use and importance
        - Also known as parallel systems, tightly-coupled systems
        - Advatage include:
          - Increased throughput
          - Economy of scale
          - Increased reliability - graceful degradation or fault tolerance
        - Two types:
          - Asymmetric Multiprocessing
          - Symmetric Multiprocessing
    - A Dual Core Desing
      - UMA, NUMA
    - Clustered Systems
      - Like multiprocessor systems, but multiple systems working together
        - Usually sharing storage via a storage-ares network(SAN)
        - Provides a high-availability service which survives failures
          - Asymmetric clustering has one machine in hot-standby mode
          - Symmetric clustering ahs multiple nodes running applications, monitoring each other
        - Some clusters are for high-performance computing(HPC)
          - Applications must be written to use parallelization
        - Some have distributed lock manager(DLM) to avoid confliciting operations
    - Operating System Structure
      - Multiprogramming needed for efficiency
        - Single user cannot keep CPU and I/O devices busy at all times
        - Multiprogramming organizes jobs(code and data) so CPU always has one to execute
        - A subset of total jobs in system is kept in memory
        - One job selected and run via job scheduling
        - When it has to wait(for I/O for example), OS switches to another job
      - Timesharing(multitasking) is logical extension in which CPU switches jobs so freqeuntly that users can interact with each job while it is running, creating interactive computing
        - Response time should be < 1 second
        - Each user has at least one program executing in memory => process
        - If several jobs ready to run at the same time -> CPU scheduling
        - If processes don't fit in memory, swapping moves them in and out to run
        - Virtual memroy allows execution of processes not completely in memory
- What was interesting: 
  - First OS class finished
- What I regret: 
  - Did't prepare part-time class
