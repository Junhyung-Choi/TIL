- What I learned:
  - Algorithm
    - Interpolation Search
    - When the sorted data is stored in an array, linear interpolation predicts which part of the navigation space (the smallest to largest set of numbers) you want to find and compares it with that number. It continues to explore in the same way, depending on its results.
- What was interesting:
  - I did all the dishes and chores I had to do.
  - I like the neat house.
- What I regret:
  - I overslept yesterday, but I think I'll ruin my sleeping habit if I keep going like this. Let's get up early tomorrow.
