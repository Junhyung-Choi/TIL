- What I learned:
  - VSCODE User Snippet: File -> Preference -> User Snippets
    - prefix: Ctrl + Space -> Auto Complete
    - body: contents
  - Linear Algebra
    -  Cramer's Rule
       - Ax = b : When the n x n matrix A has a nonzero determinant(which means A is invertible) and the vector x is the column vector of the variables.
       <!-- Ax = b: A의 행렬식(determinant)이 0이 아니고(detA가 0이 아니다 == 행렬 A가 가역이다(invertible)), 벡터 x 가 변수로 이루어진 열로 이루어진 상황 -->
       - In this case, the system has a unique solution, whose individual values for the unknowns are given by x(i) = det(Ai) / det(A) (i = 1,...,n)
- What was interesting: 
  - Ctrl + Space turns on suggestion, wanna know how to turn suggestion always 
- What I regret:
  - Playing Issac to much
